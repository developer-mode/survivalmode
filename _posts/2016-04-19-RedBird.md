It wasn't a very interesting first day out in the wild. I remained occupied with studying for a Math test, that went a lot better than expected. When I did get the time to explore however, I decided to be lazy and sit near on a swing hanging down from the tall trees watching the butterflies.

Among these, I found something quite interesting.

Here's a link to it on [Behance](https://dribbble.com/shots/2662392-A-beginner-s-guide-to-being-invisible). 

I don't particularly know what to think of this design. It seems quite simplistic, but still feels amateurish. I want to be able to know what's wrong with this design so that I can ensure I don't fall into the same trap it has.   

In other news, surviving in this forest might require me to have some spare time on my hands. As a means to this, I plan on taking another shot at going polyphasic (Polyphasic Sleep... you should google it if you haven't already... Why are you still reading this? Go google this). I'll log my experiences through this on another blog, which I'll post a link to when It's ready. (If you're reading this in the future, it's probably in one of the posts following this one).
