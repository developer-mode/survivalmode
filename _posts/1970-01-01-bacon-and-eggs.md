I enter a forest. Bad ideas to begin with. A neon sign tells me that it's too late to turn back. I'm not sure why neon signs exist in forests to begin with, but I don't question my imagination, I've seen weirder things in lucid dreams. Anyways, along with me on this expedition are 2 friends, people that could be useful through this little expedition (for emotional comfort or as a source of food, I'm not entirely sure just yet).

The point of this expedition is two fold - 

1.  To discover and improve on my writing skills
2.  Learn cool things

As long as I'm in this forest, I'll try my best to survive in an unfamiliar land and leave with memories, skills and [Github](http://github.com/pranaygp) stats. As a part of this, I'll also ensure that I challenge myself often with new ideas. 

> The first challenge of this blog is: After I hit the period key, I won't go back and change any text (It's like survivng in the real world. You can't change your actions in the past). However, I will fix typos. This way, I force myself to be more confident with what I type, and this hopefully carries over to the code I write.

Oh, also, this is something I should've mentioned earlier. This expedition was sponsored by [developermo.de](http://developermo.de) . What that means is - I'll force myself to learn something new, and blog about it (or teach another developermo.de member what I learnt, who'll then make a post on my blog)

Let's see where this expedition leads me, and hopefully me and learn something about each other and come out of this with memories.

Cheers
